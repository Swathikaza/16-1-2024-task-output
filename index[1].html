        <p3>Data mining is increasingly being used to gain competitive advantage. In this chapter,
we propose a principle of maximum performance efficiency (MPE) as a contribution to
the data-mining toolkit. This principle seeks to estimate optimal or boundary behavior,
in contrast to techniques like regression analysis that predict average behavior. This
MPE principle is explained in the context of activity-based costing situation.
Specifically, we consider the activity-based costing situation in which multiple
activities generate a common cost pool. Individual cost drivers are assigned to the
respective activities, but allocation of the cost pool to the individual activities is
regarded as impractical or expensive. Our study focuses on published data from a set</p3>
        <h2> Troutt, Gribbin, Shanker & Zhang</h2>
        <p4>of property tax collection offices, called Rates Departments, for the London metropolitan
area. We define what may be called benchmark or most efficient average costs per unit
of driver. The MPE principle is then used to estimate the best practice cost rates. A
validation approach for this estimation method is developed in terms of what we call
normal-like-or-better performance effectiveness. Extensions to time-series data on a
single unit, and marginal cost-oriented basic cost models are also briefly described.
In conclusion, we discuss potential data-mining applications and considerations.</p4>
        <center><b>INTRODUCTION</b></center>
        <p5>In recent years, companies have started to realize the potential of using data-mining
techniques as a form of competitive advantage. For example, in the finance industry, in
the decade from 1980 to 1990, the number of credit cards issued doubled to about 260
million. But, in the next ten years, there was not another doubling of this number. Given
that there are now about 280 million people in the United States, it is widely believed that
the credit card market is saturated (Berson, Smith, & Thearling, 2000). In such situations,
any gains by one company leads to a loss for another — a zero-sum game. To gain
competitive advantage, credit card companies are now resorting to data-mining techniques to retain and identify good customers at minimal cost.
The cell phone industry is also expected to go the way of the credit card market.
Soon, the cellular industry will be saturated; everybody who needs cells phone will have
one. Companies who are able to predict and understand customer needs better, will
probably be the ones who will survive. The cellular industry, like the credit card industry,
is likewise resorting to data-mining techniques to identify traits for retaining good
customers.
Research in data mining has so far focused on either developing new techniques
or on identifying applications. Being a multidisciplinary field, data-mining techniques
have originated from areas of artificial intelligence, database theory, visualization,
mathematics, operations research, and statistics, among others. Many of the well-known
statistical techniques like nearest neighbor, clustering, and regression analysis are now
part of the data-mining toolkit.
In this chapter, we present a new technique based on the principal of maximum
performance efficiency (MPE). While techniques like linear regression analysis are used
to predict average behavior, MPE seeks to predict boundary or optimal behavior. In many
cases, such models are actually more desirable. For example, in a saturated credit card
or cellular phone market, a company may seek to predict characteristics of its best
customers. In essence, choosing to concentrate on customers who are low risk/cost to
maximize profit. Such models, usually called ceiling/floor models, can also be used as part
of data-mining techniques for benchmarking. For example, a company may be interested
in comparing the quality of its products over different product lines. The MPE criterion
seeks to identify the characteristics of the best performing unit, thus allowing the
company to implement these measures in other units to improve their quality, and hence
the competitive advantage of the company across product lines.
We propose the MPE principle and show how it can be used to estimate the best
practice costs in an activity-based costing situation. The rest of the chapter is organized

as follows. In the next section, we present our initial motivation for developing the MPE
principle. As an example, we consider an activity-based costing situation where multiple
activities generate a common cost pool. Our objective is to estimate the best practice cost
rates. The following section then distinguishes between basic cost models and the
models used to estimate the parameters of the basic cost models. The maximum performance efficiency (MPE) principle is developed using an aggregate efficiency measure
that is the sum or average of performance efficiencies. Then the MPE principle is used
to derive the linear programming estimation model. The next section describes the data
for the study. The MPE criterion is applied to this data, and the results are compared with
a previous analysis to assess face validity for the proposed new method. The following
section proposes a model aptness theory based on the gamma distribution and a
technique called vertical density representation. The fitted performance efficiency
scores are required to satisfy a benchmark for validity of the goal assumption called
normal-like-or-better performance effectiveness. This is followed by limitations and
some extensions to other basic cost models. The next section discusses potential datamining applications and considerations, and is followed by the Conclusions section.</p5>

        <center><b>MOTIVATION</b></center>
        <p6>Managerial accountants are often called upon to provide measures of performance
efficiency. Such a task is essentially trivial if there is a single input measure and a single
output measure. One could simply divide the output measure by the input measure and
use the resulting performance efficiency measure to either: (1) compare the unit’s
performance over time, or (2) compare the unit’s performance with other comparable
units.
While there are numerous purposes for performance efficiency measures (i.e.,
performance evaluation, managerial compensation, benchmarking, and cost control, to
name a few), the specific purpose of this research is to explain and illustrate how a
proposed estimation principle can be used with activity-based costing for determining
performance efficiency measures for the purpose of cost control. Activity-based costing
is one approach that could be used to develop a performance measure for such purposes.
Activity-based costing consists of disaggregating costs into specific cost pools that can
be linked causally with their respective activities. Cooper and Kaplan (1992) illustrate
how such an approach can be used with purchase order data. The approach consists of
dividing the monthly cost of processing purchase orders by the number of purchase
orders processed per month. This purchase order cost can then be used as a benchmark
for comparison purposes. This approach is very simple and easy to use if there is only
one cost pool and one activity with a single cost driver. But there are many realistic
scenarios in which there are multiple cost drivers for a single cost pool. For example,
faculty salaries for an academic unit (department or college) appear to be driven by at least
two cost drivers. Both student credit hours generated and the level of academic degrees</p6>
